This is a Flutter embedding demo into MAUI apps,

There are 3 Flutter views/components in flutter_app:
1. Component One (main_component_one.dart)
2. Component Two (main_component_two.dart)
3. Main Page (main_page.dart)
Files of interest are: size_reporter.dart

There is a native Android project (Android.Native) referencing the flutter project (flutter_app).
Files of interest are: Binding.kt

There is a .NET binding project (Android.Binding) referencing the native Android project.
Files of interest are: Com.Maui.Binding.Binding.cs - generated file

There is a MAUI project (MauiDemoApp) referencing the .NET binding project.
Files of interest are: FlutterViewHandler.cs, FlutterPageHandler.cs, FlutterPage.xaml, PageWithFlutterView.cs, FlutterView.cs

To build use build_all.sh, pass --<platform> [an, ios] to build for the respective platform, pass -f to skip building the Flutter project (can save time if no changes to flutter files), pass -n to skip the native project build (when changes are not in flutter nor the native code) pass --do-binding-build to include the binding build step (but is often redundant as building the MAUI project always rebuilds the binding).

Ignore the iOS platform for now!

Ignore intellisense errors from the Com.Maui.Binding.Binding.cs and other generated files, they are false positives in most cases, if the build fails I will let you know.

The MAUI project is run separately, I will run it and provide you outputs from logcat do not do anything with logcat yourself either!

If you add logging into any part of the project, prefix it with "~LOG~ " for simple identification.

Minimal yapping! No summaries! Do not state the obvious!
